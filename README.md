One of the three learn & build projects from gamedev.tv's 
"Complete Godot 2D: Develop Your Own 2D Games Using Godot 4"

It taught me about the basic fundamentals of Godot's game engine
building blocks, such as:

- Scenes
- Nodes
- Signals
- Some of the basic node's functionality
- Some built-in functions
